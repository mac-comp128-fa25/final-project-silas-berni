# Content-Based Filtering For Personalized Movie Recommendation

The rise of streaming services denotes a shift in what features and services television viewers value most. Streaming viewership surpassed cable and network television viewership for the first time in May of 2025, and the disparity between the two only continues to grow. One attribute of these platforms to which their meteoric success can be partially attributed is their implementation of personalized content recommendations. This feature is essential for satisfying viewers who are spoiled for choice with the vast catalogues provided by popular streaming services, meaning it is also essential for the retention of revenue, which these viewers provide. 
This program is a rudimentary version of these recommendation algorithms using content-based filtering and Jaccard Similarity comparisons. It allows the user to keep a journal of the movies they have watched and a rating representing how much they have enjoyed them. This journal is then used to generate personalized movie recommendations for each user.

## Expected Functionality
- The user runs the program using the Run menu in VSCode. The whole program runs through the VSCode Terminal.
- The user is then prompted to enter a number into the console and choose between four available options. There are:
  - Enter one to see their journal, where the movies they have already watched and their respective ratings are stored.
  - Enter two to log in a new movie into their journal. If this option is selected, they will be asked to log the title and rating for the movie.
  - Enter three to get a movie recommendation. If this option is selected, they will be asked how many movies they want to be recommended.
  - Enter four to exit the program.
- Once the user has finished using one of the functionalities, they are prompted with the same four options again.
